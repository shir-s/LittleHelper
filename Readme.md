**You're a tiny fox on a big mission — help Grandma cook her famous soup.**

## The Game

You're a small fox on a big mission: gather all the ingredients to help Grandma cook her legendary soup.  
To succeed, you'll need to sprint, dodge, and survive a house full of dangers:

- The **freezing fridge**    
- **Angry moles** in the garden      
- A **rat-infested basement**     
- And worst of all... the risk of disappointing Grandma   

When you die (and you will — a lot), head to Grandma’s *cabinet of homemade “medicine”* for power-ups that might give you the edge you need.

> Just don’t come back empty-pawed.
